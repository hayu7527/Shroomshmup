second entry

feedback: 
Projectiles too fast, meaning it was easy to trap the other player simply by spamming the buttons. 
having enemies might be too much for this game, it gets really busy on the screen when the two players are shooting at eachother
too little lives meaning that it's easy to lose the game

Final modifications: 
Aside from adding sound and more images, I've changed the game according to the feedback that I recieved from friends. I learned that for a simple shmup game such as this one, it is very easy to overcrowd the playspace and make it difficult for players to discern what is exactly going on. I also learned that in a player versus player setting it is difficult to be able to scale how often a player fires at the other, especially in my case the player just wound up trapped in the corner of the screen as the other spammed the shoot button. To remedy this issue i gave the players more shield levels and also instead of enemies had shield recovery powerups instead.
The most important lesson i've learned in this making experience, is not to work on things too late and wind up hitting the wrong buttons resulting in deleting all your game files.
